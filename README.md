A card/board game built in Unity 


Rules/Directions:
Game does not currently enforce rules and the UI is not very good because I'm not sure how to do certain things (click and drag)

There are 3 buttons on the right hand side, Play, Discard, End Turn. Discard isnt currently useful because the game isn't complete

Play draws 3 cards from the deck and puts them in the choose area on the left
on each turn, both players are allowed to pick one of the three cards. Alternate turns for who gets to pick first.

Each players  hand can store up to 3 cards. To pick a card, select a spot to keep that card by pressing one of the select buttons. 
Press select  next to the card you want to pick and then finally press Draw next to your hand.

To play a card on the board, make sure the arrow in your hand is pointing to the card you want to play. Select a spot on the board to play on and finally press play.

Points are scored by having a row/column/diagonal of your cards. Points gained each turn are equal to the total power in that row/column/diagonal.
If both players play a card in the same spot on the board, the difference is calculated> If it is positive, player 1 has more power in that area if it is negative, player 2 would benefit

After both players play 1 card, the turn ends by clicking End Turn on the right. This will update the score. The game ends after 12 turns.
